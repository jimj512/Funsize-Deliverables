1. Home, current offer(s)

2. Cirrus, software

3. Updates/Notifications


I say we keep home screen to
Day 0
Current offers available. If there is no offer to display, we need nice simple clear typography explaining what the app is and what to expect in future.
IF you have software available that panel for cirrus will be open and on top of the current offers.

Day 1+
Any update or future software purchased would invoke notification which takes you to app with correct panel open. So I as user have an update available. I click that, it spawns app with the updates panel open on top of current offer.

Essentially this just keeps the root level consistent as current offers. There is also the visual element on the tabs that let you know something is available if that panel is collapsed.

Quite simply the app is only 3 things, offers, software and updates… shoe horning other experiences makes it more odd.",https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/121146199,Johnnie Hamn,,"Zero Day (no offer) https://invis.io/ZX7FQ0W7S#/166410711_Zero_Day_-_Title_Page (Johnnie Hamn - Jun 26, 2016)",,home: zero day screen (no offer),not completed
